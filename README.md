# Donut Store

This is a practice client side app for me.  

Here are the user stories:
1. The user can see a list of donuts and add them to a cart to checkout.  The cart will keep the donuts, number, cost per donut type, and a running total.  When the user 'buys' the donut, the donut store updates the number of donuts sold and total revenue.  

Use: Bower, Bootstrap, Jquery, RequireJs, and KnockoutJS (for data binding)
